# 📖 Overview

## Summary

 My recent paper "Age Prediction from Retinal Fundus Images and Segmented Vessel Images using Deep Learning" is accepted for ARVO 2023.

I am a graduate student in University College London, studying my graduate program in Computer Graphics, Vision and Imaging. I worked as a Research Fellow in Moorfield Eye Hospital during summer 2022. I did my thesis project with Professor Keane Pearse. Later I submit my project to ARVO. My paper is currently under review.

I completed my bachelor degrees at University of California, San Diego with a Double Major in Computer Engineering and Applied Mathematics. I graduated in December, 2020. Then I worked in IQIYI as a Data Analyst for the first half of 2021.

I worked at Jiuyang Media as Software Development Engineer intern during summer 2021, and was doing research with NYU Professor Jean-Claude Franchitti. Later I also published my first paper"Real-Time Age Estimation using Convolutional Neural Network" in later 2021.
