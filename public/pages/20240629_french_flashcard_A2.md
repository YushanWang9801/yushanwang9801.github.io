Remember the A1 flashcards that helped you nail "bonjour" and "au revoir"? They just leveled up.  

Say hello to **A2 French vocabulary** in the flashcard app—perfect for anyone ready to move beyond basics.  

### What’s new for A2?  
- Trickier (but super useful) words: Think "réserver une chambre" (book a room) or "prendre le métro" (take the subway).  
- Expanded scenarios: Work conversations, travel logistics, and everyday routines that feel less "textbook" and more "real life."  
- Same fan-favorite features: Flip cards for translations, click to hear pronunciation, and example sentences that actually make sense.  

Whether you’re prepping for CEFR A2 or just want to sound less like a beginner, it’s all here.
