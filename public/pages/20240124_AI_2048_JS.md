## From Python to Browser: 2048 Gets a JavaScript Web Version!  

#### Written at Jan 24, 2024

After sharing the Python version of 2048, many students asked, "Is there a version we can play without setting up an environment?" So I spent some free time porting this little game to the web—rewriting it with Vue. Now you can play it directly in your browser, no setup needed!  

The code could be found in https://github.com/YushanWang9801/2048_AI  under the branch named JS-version.

Like the Python version, the web edition keeps the core gameplay: use arrow keys to move and merge tiles, with the goal still being to reach 2048. But the web version has obvious perks: no need to install Python or Pygame, no code cloning required. Just open the link and play—plus, it works smoothly on mobile too.  

Visually, it retains the clean style of the original but with smoother animations: tiles glide gently when moving, numbers pop slightly when merged, and button hover effects feel more polished. Under the hood, I refactored the game logic using JavaScript’s object-oriented approach, packaging core functions like grid operations and score calculation into modular methods—making it easier for curious learners to compare with the Python code.  

If you want to give it a quick play, or check out how the web version differs from the Python implementation, just click here:
