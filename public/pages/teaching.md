## Turning a Page

Earlier this year, I founded *Injection OCR* in Vancouver—a project I had envisioned for a long time. Starting a company overseas was a deeply personal step forward, not only professionally but also in terms of growth and challenge.

However, life doesn’t always follow the plans we set. My initial work permit application was rejected. While disappointing, it gave me a chance to reassess, reset, and think carefully about the next phase.

I’ve decided to return to Beijing for a time while I resubmit my application. In the meantime, I’ve made a conscious choice not to pursue any work that would create a conflict with my existing company. Instead, I’ve chosen something that aligns with my long-term values: teaching.

I’m joining **Vision Overseas Education Ltd.** as an academic lecturer. Teaching has always been something I find not only intellectually engaging but emotionally meaningful. It’s a way to build real, long-term impact—not just through one person, but through every student they in turn might inspire.

> *If one person can positively influence 10 others, and each of them goes on to influence 10 more, then in just five iterations, that impact reaches 100,000 people.*

> Teaching, to me, is the most direct path to that kind of exponential change.

In the coming months, I’ll be focusing on courses in:

* English
* Mathematics
* Calculus
* Competitive Mathematics
* Programming
* Computing for Business, Science and Design for the University of New South Wales (UNSW)

This opportunity gives me space to do what I love while continuing to prepare for the future. More importantly, it allows me to invest my time in something I believe in: education as a force multiplier.
